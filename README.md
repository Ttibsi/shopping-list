# todo-list
A web application todo list app - I'm using this to gain some experience
with Flask and to learn typescript.

### TO Run:
Run `make setup` firstly to set up your environment.

Run `make server` to start the server and `make client` to start the client in
different terminal windows, then go to `localhost:8000` in your browser
